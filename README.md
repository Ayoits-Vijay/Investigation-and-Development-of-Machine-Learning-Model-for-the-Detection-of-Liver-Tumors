# Investigation-and-Development-of-Machine-Learning-Model-for-the-Detection-of-Liver-Tumors
This project focuses on automated liver and tumor segmentation from CT scan images using deep learning models like U-Net and ResUNet. The system processes medical images from the LiTS dataset, performs preprocessing, model training, and postprocessing to accurately detect and highlight liver tumors.
